Computer vision demos / algorithms.
Deployed webpage with demos to follow. 

<!-- 
## Object detection 
- Welzl's Algorithm
- Separating Axis Theorem
- Ray Casting

## Pathfinding
- Dijkstra's
- A*
- BFS
- Steering (seek, flee, wander)

## Edge detection
- Canny Edge Detection
- Sobel filter
- Hough

## Image filtering
For this, could make a thing where you upload your image and can add one of these effects: 
- Gaussian Blur
- Bilateral filter
- Grayscale conversion
- Color thresholding for object recognition?

## PCG
- Midpoint Displacement Algorithm
